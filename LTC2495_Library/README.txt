This is a library designed to interface with the LTC2495 ADC via I2C interface using an Arduino
This software was designed to work the Arduino IDE and provides the user with functions to read voltages from any pin 
on the device, as well as setup the device in terms of reference voltage and internal device parameters (such as gains 
and filtering). This is designed to allow easy user interface with the device with minimal to no low level programing.

As of 5/12/2017 this software was in BETA stage

Contents:

LTC2495.cpp		#This is the C++ file defining the library and it's functions

LTC2495.h 		#this is the header file to be referenced in the arduino files for the library
